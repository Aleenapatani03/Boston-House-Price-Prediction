#Boston House Price Prediction

##This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using machine learning regression models. We implemented several regression algorithms to determine the best model based on performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
